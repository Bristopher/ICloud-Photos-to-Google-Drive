# ICloud-Photos-to-Google-Drive
ICloud Photos Share-Link to Google Drive Copier
-The purpose of this for me personally is when I go skateboarding and record a bunch of videos of my friend's trying a clip this lets me relatively easily import them into Google Drive (A Could storage with more space than Icloud). I went with this solution because using the google drive app to upload all the files just takes too long with how ISP's restrict upload (10Mbps Up but 250Mbps down smh) 
I could just use Google Drive storage to start and not ICloud but the Apple ecosystem got me ðŸ˜ª
